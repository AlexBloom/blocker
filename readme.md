##Getting Started</h1>
To get started, select a color from the toolbar on the bottom of the screen and
click on the canvas. A transparent block shows you where the next block will be positioned
when you click.

There are three edit modes available. You can switch between modes in the toolbar.

##Drawing Modes</h1>

- In _single block_ mode you can add one block at a time to the canvas.
- In the <strong>multiple blocks</strong> mode, you can add multiple blocks to the canvas. Using the sliders in the toolbar, you can adjust the size of the	grid.
- You can use the <strong>delete</strong> mode to remove blocks from the canvas. Click on a block to add it to the selection (it turns black). To remove all selected blocks, click on the delete button in the toolbar or backspace on you keyboard.

You can use the history buttons to undo and redo your actions.

- _save_ your sketch. This saves your sketch on your local machine.
- _load_ a sketch. you can choose from sketches you saved before.
- _import a sketch from a file.
- _export_ a sketch from a to a file. There are two output formats available: ```html``` and ```json```. Export your sketch as ```html``` to embed it on other websites. Export it as ```json``` if you want to import and modify it later on using this editor.
